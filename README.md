# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

Using ```JavaScript```, ```Leaflet```, ```Mapbox```, and ```HTML``` an interactive vizualization was created for earthquakes accross the world.

## Resources

- Software:
  - Javascript
  - D3, Leafleat and Mapbox
  - HTML
  - GeoJSON

- Datasets:
  - Earthquakes Data: [GeoJSON file](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)
  - Tectonic Plates Data: [GeoJSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)
  - Major Earthquakes Data: [GeoJSON file](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)

## Results

The interactive map is shown in the images below. We can see that the circle-marker's size and color is according with the earthquake's magnitude (a red bigger circle means a higher magnitud earthquake). Note that you can select between three different *views/modes* Streets, Satellite and Dark.

Additionally, there are three layers showing information: The general earthquakes data, the tectonic plates data and the earthquakes with a magnitud higher that 4.5, you can also select the layer of your interest or the three of them at the same time.
